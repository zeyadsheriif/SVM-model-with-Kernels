# SVM-model-with-Kernels 

SVM Machine Learning Model Implemented with kernels

Objective: The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Support Vector Machines (SVM) using built-in functions and understanding the concept of kernels in SVM. 

Project steps:

1-SVM Classification: Use the provided 2-D dataset available in the repository files to classify the classes using SVM with built-in functions.

2-Visulization:
- Divide the background into a grid of points.
- Classify each point in the grid using the SVM model trained in step 1.

3-Assign each point in the grid the same color code as the class it belongs to base on the SVM classification results (as the attached expected output video).

Resources: 2-D Dataset with equivalent name of code file that classifies and visualizes it.
